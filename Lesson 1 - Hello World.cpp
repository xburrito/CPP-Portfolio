/*
1. "<iostream>" is a header file that contains a list of functions necessary
such as cout etc. The #include is the preprocessor that tells the program to
include this  header file.

2.Namespaces are used to organize code into logical groups and to prevent name
collisions that can occur especially when your code base includes multiple
libraries.

3.Note: When coding, it's always crucial to keep in the back of your mind to
leave comments which will help fellow programmers follow through your code when
working in collaborations or projects.
